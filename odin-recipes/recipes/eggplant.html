    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="desc-para">This delicious stuffed eggplant with a cheesy top is a must-try recipe! Great as a hearty main but you can buy the mini eggplants and use them for a side dish or appetizer.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredient-list">
        <li><strong>Eggplant: </strong>You'll need one eggplant (halved lengthwise) to make two servings.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil: </strong>Brush the shells with olive oil before seasoning with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>This stuffed eggplant is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and fresh basil. </li>
        <li><strong>Sausage: </strong>Sweet Italian sausage makes this stuffed eggplant a hearty, crowd-pleasing meal. </li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables: </strong>An onion and fresh mushrooms lend texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta Sauce: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade tomato-basil pasta sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread Crumbs: </strong>Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs give the stuffed eggplant a welcome crunch. </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese: </strong>For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese instead of using the pre-shredded stuff. </li>
    </ul>
